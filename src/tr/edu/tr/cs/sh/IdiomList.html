	  		Allegory[edit]
Allegory is a figurative mode of representation conveying meaning other 
than the literal. Allegory communicates its message by means of symbolic figures, 
actions or symbolic representation. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of rhetoric, 
but an allegory does not have to be expressed in language: 
it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in realistic painting. 
An example of a simple visual allegory is the image of the grim reaper. 
Viewers understand that the image of the grim reaper is a symbolic representation of death.
